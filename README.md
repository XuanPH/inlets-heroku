# Inlets Reverse Proxy

## What is this?

Briefly, `inlets` allow you to expose your local host to the Internet, through any NAT or firewall.

It can be an alternative solution to `ngrok` or `localtunnel`. It can be deployed to **heroku**, so you can have your own **fixed address**, which will be better if you want to test a **webhook server**.

The original project can be found here: [https://github.com/inlets/inlets](https://github.com/inlets/inlets)
